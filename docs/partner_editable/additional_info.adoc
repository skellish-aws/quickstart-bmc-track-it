=== Install BMC Client Management relay agent
After deployment, you must install a BMC Client Management relay agent on one of your on-premises Microsoft Windows servers. A relay agent collects and transmits data from your on-premises network infrastructure to the BMC Client Management server on the Track-It EC2 instance.

NOTE: These instructions describe a Windows relay agent installation. To install a relay agent on Linux, see https://docs.bmc.com/docs/bcm2008/rolling-out-the-relay-agents-930382510.html[Rolling out the relay agents^].

. Open the https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation console^].
. On the *Stacks* page, choose the stack name.
. On the *Outputs* tab, note the URL in the *Value* column of the *BCMRolloutPublicURL* key.

. The BMC Client Management login page displays. Log in with the password you entered for the `TrackItBcmAdminPassword` link:#_parameter_reference[parameter] during deployment. 
. On the *Welcome to the Rollout Server Download Page*, choose *BCM_Agent_Install.exe* in the *Auto-extractable Name* column.
. A Windows Defender warning displays. Choose *More info*, then *Run anyway*.
. After the installation is complete, a message stating *The Agent has been installed successfully* displays. Choose *OK*.
